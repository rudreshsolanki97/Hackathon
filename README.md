# Open Hackathon

## VISION

To innovate and replace existing non-efficient closed systems with more transparent, efficient system using blockchain.

## NOTES
1. Participants are given complete freedom for choosing technology, programming languages etc. in the development of the application.
2. Problem statements are meant to be generic in order to give participants flexibility to work around.

## Submission Guidelines
 [Submission Guidelines](./SubmissionGuide).


## Open Problem Statements

Below we have listed the problem statements which are open to all. In order to participate, create a proposal in the format specified & make a pull request.

Prizes upto $10000 USD worth of XDC will be given if your solution is expected.

### Change Proof of Work (PoW) Consensus in blockchain

Too much energy consumption makes PoW consensus non practical and not suitable for real world system.
We need to find out other innovative consensus where transaction and network remains de-centralised but without much energy consumption.
Restriction numbers of node make its more centralized while large number of nodes makes the system very slow.
Many industry experts are trying out different consensus like DPoS.
We need to find out innovative solution to replace PoW Consensus with other Consensus which gives more efficiency, speed and less energy consumption.

### Cross Blockchain Interoperability.

Various blockchain need to connect to each other to create more efficiency in system. Like Bitcoin, Ripple and IOTA. We need to Create Bridge between various blockchain.
